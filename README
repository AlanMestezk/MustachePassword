# Mustache Password

Mustache Password is an application developed with the purpose of being an efficient password generator.

## Features

The application's operation is simple and intuitive, consisting of two distinct screens:

### Password Generator

On this screen, the user can select the desired length for the password to be generated. After making this choice, simply press the corresponding button to generate the password. Once generated, the password is automatically copied to the device's clipboard, making it easy to use in any desired context.

### Password Management

This screen offers users the ability to manage previously saved passwords. Here, it is possible to remove passwords that are no longer needed and copy any stored password for immediate use.

## Technologies Used

In building this application, we used the powerful combination of React Native, Expo, and TypeScript to explore and take full advantage of all the capabilities offered by these cutting-edge technologies.

With a simplified interface and essential features, Mustache Password stands out as a practical and reliable tool for password generation and management.
